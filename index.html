        <p> I love cats and have two furry companions named Ocho and Ola.  My favorite color is pink, and I enjoy cooking, especially Italian dishes like homemade pasta. I also like trying new recipes from around the world, such as sushi. In my free time, I love dancing and traveling to new places, as well as reading mystery novels.I'm interested in web development because it lets me combine creativity and technical skills to build interactive, visually appealing websites. I enjoy bringing ideas to life and continuously learning new technologies.</p>
